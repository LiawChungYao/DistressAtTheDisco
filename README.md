# Project 2 Report

Read the [project 2
specification](https://github.com/COMP30019/Project-2-Specification) for
details on what needs to be covered here. You may modify this template as you see fit, but please
keep the same general structure and headings.

Remember that you must also continue to maintain the Game Design Document (GDD)
in the `GDD.md` file (as discussed in the specification). We've provided a
placeholder for it [here](GDD.md).

## Evaluation Plan

Evaluation techniques: 
* For the querying technique, we are utilizing a questionnaire which will be provided to the end users. The questionnaire uses Google Forms, as data collection can be summarized and each responses to each question will be grouped together. Other than that. Using Google Forms, as compared to physical forms, means that we can conduct playtesting with a wide range of audiences. This means, our questionnaire can observe the perspectives and opinions of the game from audiences of different background.
* For the observational technique, we have used Cooperative Evaluation. Since the game has some unique mechanics, a cooperative evaluation was conducted gauge the intuitiveness of the game and any confusion end users have would be immediately clarified. The method of cooperative evaluation was conducted through an online call through Discord and the end users would stream their experience.

Participants: 
* Target audience: The end users chosen for feedback and evaluation are young adults who have an interest in shooting games and music.
* The recruitment will be gathered from university students where a high percentage of them are young adults. We will then pick students who have acuity in FPS games or have interest in playing.

Data collection: 
* For data and feedback collection, the querying technique feedback will be from Google Forms. This consists of their overall experience, intuitiveness, the parts they enjoyed, the parts they did not enjoy and improvements made.
* For the observational technique, the observations were just noted down by the interviewer. Some of the features that were noted was their actions in the game, the questions they had, the observations they had while playing.

Data analysis: 
* Analysis of survey responses to identity player satisfaction and pain
* Review gameplay data to identify player behaviors 
* The metrics used to evaluate the game include: player satisfaction score from surveys, common issues identified during testing, gameplay metrics (completion rate, time to completion, and difficulty), bugs and errors tracking. Moreover, we will consider player suggestions and feedback for improvements.

Timeline: 
* We will spend 7 days to gather feedback from players, 14 days to improve the game.

Responsibilities: 
* Everybody in the team will gather feedback and information. For the improvement of the game after feedback, each person will analyze the feedback information and work on their part of the game.
* Duc Huy Le: Enemy
* Nicholas Boylan: Boss fight 
* Yuen Ying Wong: World creation
* Chung Yao Liaw: Shader
